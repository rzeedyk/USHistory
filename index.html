            <p>You are about to embark on a journey through one of the most pivotal periods in American history. Your choices will shape the course of events. Are you ready to make history?</p>

            <h2>The Boston Tea Party</h2>
            <p>It's December 16, 1773. You find yourself in Boston Harbor, where tensions are high due to unfair taxation. A group of colonists are planning to dump British tea into the harbor as a form of protest.</p>
            <p>What do you choose to do?</p>

            <h2>Joining the Boston Tea Party</h2>
            <p>You decide to join the protesters. Disguised as a Mohawk Indian, you board the ship and start throwing tea overboard. The splash of the tea crates hitting the water is oddly satisfying.</p>
            <p>What's your next move?</p>

            <h2>Warning the British</h2>
            <p>You rush to warn the British about the impending protest. They appreciate the information but seem unsure how to respond. Your loyalist leanings may have consequences...</p>
            <p>What will you do now?</p>

            <h2>Paul Revere's Midnight Ride</h2>
            <p>It's April 18, 1775. You're Paul Revere, and you've just found out the British are coming to arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock. It's like finding out the school principal is on their way to bust the most popular kids for planning a massive food fight!</p>
            <p>You need to warn everyone, but how? No smartphones, no social media... just you, a horse, and a whole lot of determination.</p>
            <p>Choose your next move:</p>

            <h2>The Midnight Ride Begins!</h2>
            <p>You jump on your horse faster than you've ever moved in your life. As you gallop through the dark streets, you realize something shocking - you're basically the colonial version of a group text!</p>
            <p>But uh-oh, you spot some British soldiers up ahead. What do you do?</p>
            <button onclick="choosePath('stealth')">Try to sneak past them quietly</button>

        <section id="friends" style="display:none;">
            <h2>Teamwork Makes the Dream Work</h2>
            <p>You gather your crew faster than assembling a squad for dodgeball. Your friend William Dawes joins you, and you split up to cover more ground.</p>
            <p>As you ride, you come across a group of teenagers having a secret bonfire. Do you:</p>

        <section id="stealth" style="display:none;">
            <h2>Stealth Mode: Activated</h2>
            <p>You try to sneak past the British soldiers, your heart pounding louder than your horse's hooves. Suddenly, your horse sneezes! The soldiers look around, confused.</p>
            <p>Quick! What's your excuse?</p>
            <button onclick="choosePath('owl')">Pretend to be a really loud owl</button>

            <h2>The Loudest Town Crier</h2>
            <p>You shout "The British are coming!" so loud that you're pretty sure they heard you back in England. The soldiers are startled, and chaos erupts!</p>
            <p>People start pouring out of their houses, some in nightgowns and silly caps. It's like a midnight pajama party, but with more panic and patriotism.</p>
            <p>What's your next move, Paul?</p>
            <button onclick="choosePath('continue-ride')">Keep riding to the next town</button>

            <h2>The Ride Concludes</h2>
            <p>Your midnight ride has successfully warned the colonists. The British plan has been foiled, and the Revolutionary War is about to begin.</p>
            <p>Your actions have set the stage for the birth of a new nation. What's your next move?</p>

            <h2>The Colonies at a Crossroads</h2>
            <p>Your midnight ride has warned the colonists, and tensions with Britain are at an all-time high. As the summer of 1776 approaches, colonial leaders are gathering in Philadelphia to decide the future of the colonies.</p>
            <p>You have the chance to be part of history. What will you do?</p>

        <section id="declaration-independence" style="display:none;">
            <h2>The Declaration of Independence</h2>
            <p>It's the summer of 1776 in Philadelphia. The Continental Congress is meeting, and there's more drama than a season finale of "Stranger Things." You're part of the committee tasked with drafting the Declaration of Independence.</p>
            <p>Thomas Jefferson is hunched over his desk, quill in hand, looking like he's about to drop the hottest track of 1776. But he's stuck on the opening lines.</p>
            <p>Jefferson turns to you and asks, "How should we start this revolutionary document?"</p>
            <button onclick="choosePath('life-liberty')">Suggest "Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness"</button>

            <h2>Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness</h2>
            <p>Jefferson's eyes light up like he just got the latest iPhone (if iPhones existed in 1776). "That's perfect!" he exclaims.</p>
            <p>As the committee works on the document, John Adams bursts in. "The British are sending more troops!" he shouts. "We need to decide: do we ask for full independence now, or try one last time for peace?"</p>
            <button onclick="choosePath('full-independence')">Vote for full independence</button>
            <button onclick="choosePath('peace-attempt')">Suggest one last peace attempt</button>

        <section id="we-people" style="display:none;">
            <h2>We the People...</h2>
            <p>Jefferson scratches his head, looking more confused than a cat watching a magic trick. "That sounds more like the opening for a constitution," he says. "But let's keep it in mind for later!"</p>
            <p>Suddenly, Benjamin Franklin rushes in, his kite and key forgotten in the excitement. "I've got it!" he shouts. "What if we start with 'When in the course of human events...'"</p>
            <p>The room buzzes with excitement. What do you think?</p>
            <button onclick="choosePath('support-franklin')">Support Franklin's idea</button>
