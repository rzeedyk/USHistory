            <h2>The Battle of Trenton</h2>
            <p>It's December 25, 1776. General Washington has a daring plan to cross the Delaware River and surprise the Hessian forces in Trenton. It's so cold, you feel like you're in an episode of "Game of Thrones" - winter is definitely coming!</p>

            <p>Your actions catch Washington's eye. He asks for your input on the next steps. What do you suggest?</p>
